We could use SQL to calculate the percent change between each question, but it’s just as easy to analyze these manually 
with a calculator or in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

Mattresses and More users were asked to answer a five-question survey:

“How likely are you to recommend Mattresses and More to a friend?”
“Which Mattresses and More location do you shop at?”
“How old are you?”
“What is your gender?”
“What is your annual household income?”



If we divide the number of people completing each step by the number of people completing the previous step:
Question	Percent Completed this Question
1	100%
2	95%
3	82%
4	95%
5	74%



We see that Questions 2 and 4 have high completion rates, but Questions 3 and 5 have lower rates.

This suggests that age and household income are more sensitive questions that people might be reluctant to answer!
