Project Assignment: Usage Funnels
Warby Parker(https://www.warbyparker.com/) is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary 
price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac 
journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world — for every pair of eyeglasses and 
sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

In this project, you will analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. Here are the 
funnels and the tables that you are given:

Quiz Funnel:
survey
Home Try-On Funnel:
quiz
home_try_on
purchase
Let’s get started!

Start the following project, which will guide you through the queries you need to write with a series of questions. 
Make sure to save your queries and results — you’ll be using them to create a practice presentation. Then, using Google Slides, 
Microsoft PowerPoint, or some other presentation software, create a mock presentation. Your presentation should answer all of the 
questions in the project. Each answer should include a text explanation and data to support your claim. The queries used to find 
that data should be included in a separate .sql file.

Template: We recommend that you use the template linked here. This template contains examples of the types of slides you’ll want to use.
Rubric: You can share your work with your peers on the Codecademy forums, who can give you feedback based on this rubric. 
Make sure to check your work before sharing!

Note: This project is a collaboration with Warby Parker’s Data Science team (thank you!) and uses fictional data.

1. To help users find their perfect frame, Warby Parker has a Style Quiz (https://www.warbyparker.com/quiz) that has the following questions:

“What are you looking for?”
“What’s your fit?”
“Which shapes do you like?”
“Which colors do you like?”
“When was your last eye exam?”
The users’ responses are stored in a table called survey.

Select all columns from the first 10 rows. What columns does the table have?
select * from survey limit 10;


2. Users will “give up” at different points in the survey. Let’s analyze how many users move from Question 1 to Question 2, etc. Create 
a quiz funnel using the GROUP BY command. What is the number of responses for each question?

select question, count(response) from survey group by question;

3. Using a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets, calculate the percentage of users who answer each question:
Which question(s) of the quiz have a lower completion rates?
What do you think is the reason?

select ((500-475)*100)/500;
select ((475-380)*100)/475;
select ((380-361)*100)/380;
select ((361-270)*100)/361;
Q2 (2. What's your fit? - 5%) and Q4 (4. Which colors do you like? - 5%) have lower completion rates
more number of users are just for casual browsing hence the rate from Q1 to Q2 is less
Since the Q3 is for the specifics wrt the choice the cx have hence asking another Question for the same 
is some sort of redundancy for them, hence the rate from Q3 to Q4 is less.

4. Warby Parker’s purchase funnel is: Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses
During the Home Try-On stage, we will be conducting an A/B Test:

50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on
50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on
Let’s find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.
The data will be distributed across three tables:
quiz
home_try_on
purchase

Examine the first five rows of each table
What are the column names?

select * from quiz limit 5;
select * from home_try_on limit 5;
select * from purchase limit 5;

5. We’d like to create a new table with the following layout:
user_id	is_home_try_on	number_of_pairs	is_purchase
4e8118dc	True	3	False
291f1cca	True	5	False
75122300	False	NULL	False


Each row will represent a single user from the browse table:
If the user has any entries in home_try_on, then is_home_try_on will be True.
number_of_pairs comes from home_try_on table
If the user has any entries in purchase, then is_purchase will be True.
Use a LEFT JOIN to combine the three tables, starting with the top of the funnel (quiz) and ending with the bottom of the funnel 
(purchase).

Select only the first 10 rows from this table (otherwise, the query will run really slowly).

select quiz.user_id,
case when quiz.user_id = home_try_on.user_id then "True"
else "False" end as is_home_try_on, home_try_on.number_of_pairs,
case when home_try_on.user_id = purchase.user_id then "True"
else "False" end is_purchase from quiz left join home_try_on on quiz.user_id = home_try_on.user_id left join purchase on home_try_on.user_id = purchase.user_id limit 10;

---OR this query can be rewritten as like below:

SELECT DISTINCT q.user_id,
h.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_home_try_on',
h.number_of_pairs,
p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
FROM quiz q
LEFT JOIN home_try_on h
ON q.user_id = h.user_id
LEFT JOIN purchase p
ON p.user_id = q.user_id
LIMIT 10;


6. Once we have the data in this format, we can analyze it in several ways:

We can calculate overall conversion rates by aggregating across all rows.
We can compare conversion from quiz→home_try_on and home_try_on→purchase.
We can calculate the difference in purchase rates between customers who had 3 number_of_pairs with ones who had 5.
And more!

We can also use the original tables to calculate things like:
The most common results of the style quiz.
The most common types of purchase made.
And more!

What are some actionable insights for Warby Parker?
