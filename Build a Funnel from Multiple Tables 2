Build a Funnel from Multiple Tables 2

Combine the information from the three tables (browse, checkout, purchase) into one table with the following schema:
Each row will represent a single user:
If the user has any entries in checkout, then is_checkout will be True.
If the user has any entries in purchase, then is_purchase will be True.

I cannot use an INNER JOIN to create this table, as information will be lost from any customer who does not have a row in the checkout or purchase table. Therefore, it is advisable 
to use a series of LEFT JOIN commands.

1. Start by selecting all rows (*) from the LEFT JOIN of:

browse (aliased as b)
checkout (aliased as c)
purchase (aliased as p)
Be sure to use this order to make sure that we get all of the rows.

LIMIT your results to the first 50 so that it loads quickly.

select * from browse b left join checkout c on b.user_id = c.user_id left join purchase p on c.user_id = p.user_id limit 50;


2. But I don’t want all of these columns in the result!, Instead of selecting all columns using *, let’s select these four:

DISTINCT b.browse_date
b.user_id
c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout'
p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
Edit your query so that you select these columns.


select DISTINCT b.browse_date, b.user_id, c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout',
p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase' from browse b left join checkout c 
on b.user_id = c.user_id left join purchase p on c.user_id = p.user_id limit 50;
